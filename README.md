### Wich are the rules in Michi vs Shiba?

Just as any "Tic tac toe" game, you and your friend will have to choose a character and will take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

In this mobile version you will see the player turn marked at the top of the screen and you will have an historial of victories at the bottom.
